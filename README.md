### Results
####   Summary of Findings

Customer Sentiment Trends: 

Positive reviews were often associated with detailed, descriptive text, while negative reviews were shorter but more focused on specific issues.
Key Influencing Factors: The most influential factors for high ratings included product quality, freshness, and packaging, while issues such as delayed shipping or poor taste were prominent in low-rated reviews.
Model Performance: Predictive models, including roberta model and verdar model were employed to predict product ratings based on review content, with an accuracy of state accuracy/performance metric achieved.

Visualization Insights: 

Several key visualizations highlighted trends such as the distribution of ratings, sentiment polarity of reviews, and word frequency for positive versus negative feedback.

Future Improvements

-   Additional feature engineering.  
-   Improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.  
-   Integration of sentiment analysis for deeper insights.  
-   Exploration of alternative text-based feature   extraction methods, such as word embeddings
